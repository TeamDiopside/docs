# Creating a pack

To add custom leaves to the mod, first create an empty data pack (or use your own mod's resources).

In the data folder, create a folder with the name of the mod ID of the mod you are adding support for. In there, add a folder named separated_leaves. We will add the JSON files in there.

For instance, the folder structure for `atmospheric:morado_leaves` would be `data/atmospheric/separated_leaves/...`.

Don't know what the mod ID is? Look at the text before the ":" when hovering over the Leaves block with Advanced Tooltips enabled.
