# Creating a pack

First create an empty resource pack, or, if you are a mod developer, you can add the folders to your mod's resources.

In the `assets` folder, create a folder with the name of the mod ID of the mod you are adding support for. In there, add a folder named `seamless_rules`. If the mod ID doesn't match, it won't work.

For example, such a folder structure could be `assets/supplementaries/seamless_rules`.

Don't know what the mod ID is? Look at the text before the ":" when hovering over the item with Advanced Tooltips enabled.
