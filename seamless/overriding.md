# Overriding

It is very simple to override any built-in outline rule. You just have to create a file with the same name and in the same folders as the file you want to override and put your resource pack above the built-in one.

!!!
You can view the files of the built-in resource pack on [GitHub](https://github.com/TeamDiopside/Seamless/tree/latest/fabric/src/main/resources/resourcepacks/default_seamless/assets).
