# Done

If you did everything correctly, your files should show up in the logs when starting Minecraft or reloading with F3+T. 

If the rules don't work, your logs should contain error messages describing what went wrong and where. Good luck!

***If you end up making a pack, please let us know! We could include it in the mod :)***
